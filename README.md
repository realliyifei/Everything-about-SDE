# Everything about SDE

Everything about SDE I learn so far: algorithms, computer networks, database, operating systems, computer system, system design, cryptography, etc.

The contents are mainly from the courses at UPenn, MIT online, Coursera, etc. and the sources I browse online.

For SDE-related projects and leetcode solutions, please see their separate repos. 

Will update soon...
